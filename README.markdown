Cryptoanalysis
=============

All this grown on my deepest love to all kind of math-based algorythms and,
especially, cryptographic ones. Or, if you are fan of the naked truth, on 
fear of nearest test.

Intro
-------

The following ciphers are currently being studied:

* [Caesar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
* [Affine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_cipher) - substitution 
  cipher, containing abstraction of all shift ciphers.
* [Viginere]()
* [Enigma]()

Usage
-----

All files except `test.py` can be used like executable, all possible arguments
shown by:

    $ python filename.py -h

Also, each file can be used like module:

    #!/usr/bin/python
    import filename
